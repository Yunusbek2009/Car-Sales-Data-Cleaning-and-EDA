This repository hosts cleaning.ipynb, a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook dedicated to the meticulous cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of car sales data. The primary data source for this project is avto_elon_data.jsonl, a JSONL file containing raw vehicle listings.

The notebook systematically addresses common data quality challenges. It begins by robustly loading the JSONL data into a Pandas DataFrame, ensuring efficient handling of the dataset. A key feature of the preprocessing phase is the intelligent expansion of nested columns, such as description_params, to transform complex, semi-structured data into a flat, analyzable format. Furthermore, the notebook strategically drops irrelevant or sensitive columns like phone_number and price, ensuring data privacy and focus on relevant attributes.

A significant portion of the data preparation involves standardizing and renaming columns from their original Uzbek labels (e.g., Shahar, Yili, Yurgani) to clear, universally understandable English equivalents (e.g., City, Production_year, Milage). This crucial step enhances readability and facilitates collaboration. The notebook also demonstrates advanced feature engineering techniques, specifically extracting engine_size and fuel_type from the 'Gearbox power' column, and converting engine_size to a numeric format for quantitative analysis. Missing values are gracefully handled by filling NaN entries with spaces, ensuring data integrity for subsequent operations.

Finally, the cleaning.ipynb notebook culminates in impactful exploratory data analysis. It prepares and visualizes key relationships within the dataset, exemplified by a clear and informative plot of 'Engine Size vs Mileage'. This visualization helps in understanding car performance characteristics and identifying potential trends. This project serves as a practical example of a complete data cleaning and EDA pipeline, ideal for anyone looking to process real-world, messy datasets and extract valuable insights.
